# gdgc-ai-chatbot
This project is an AI-powered assistant built for Google Developer Groups Community.
The frontend is made in Streamlit, and it communicates with a Node.js backend that generates responses using an AI model.

i have also used some images and they are also attached. 
I have first designed the UI using figma and the link for it is:https://www.figma.com/design/yXBS0whp4TbfwDUOMtjI5k/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=oKKGaZQNkQix1BAz-1

Make sure your backend runs on:
http://localhost:3000/chat

I have also attached the final image of the bot.
